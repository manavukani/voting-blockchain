# Blockchain Voting System Project

Decentralized Election voting System project using Blockchain technology such as Metamask, hardhat, and Remix IDE.

## Motivation
Voting is a crucial aspect of democracy. While paper balloting is considered the most appropriate method to ensure everyone's right to vote, it is prone to errors and abuse. To overcome these difficulties, many countries have adopted digital voting methods. However, a single flaw in digital voting can lead to massive vote-rigging, which can compromise the integrity of the election. Therefore, it is essential to have legal, accurate, safe, and convenient election voting methods. However, issues with digital voting methods may restrict their acceptance. To address these problems, blockchain technology was developed. It provides end-to-end verification capabilities, ensuring anonymity, privacy, verifiability, mobility, integrity, security, and fairness in voting.
